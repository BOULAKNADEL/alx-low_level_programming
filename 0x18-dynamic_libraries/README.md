# Project: 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

Welcome to **0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries**. This project is an exploration of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. It's ideal for those looking to expand their knowledge of C and gain practical experience with dynamic libraries.

## ðŸ“š Overview

In C, a library is a file that contains several object files. These can be used as a single entity during the linking phase of a program. Libraries simplify the symbol search process (functions, variables, etc.), and linking a program whose object files are organized in libraries is faster than linking a program with separate object files.

There are two types of libraries in C: 

1. Static Libraries
2. Shared/Dynamic Libraries

This project primarily focuses on **Dynamic Libraries**. These libraries link to programs in two stages. During the compile-time, the linker verifies that all symbols required by the program are either linked into the program or included in one of its shared libraries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should understand:

- What a dynamic library is, and how it operates.
- The process of creating a dynamic library.
