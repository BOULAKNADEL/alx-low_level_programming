## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Tasks
- Task 0: Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- Task 1: Write a function that copies memory area.
- Task 2: Write a function that locates a character in a string.
- Task 3: Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- Task 4: Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- Task 5: Write a function that locates a substring.
- Task 6: Write a function that prints the chessboard.
- Task 7: Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## Requirements
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
