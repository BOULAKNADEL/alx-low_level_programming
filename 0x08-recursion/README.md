# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion

## Requirements

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You have to push _putchar.c and holberton.h in your repository, then make sure to push your main.c file last.
- You are not allowed to use loops of any kind (for, while, do while)
- You are not allowed to use static variables

## Tasks

0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

6. Inception. Is it possible?
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
